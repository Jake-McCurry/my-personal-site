                        <p> 
                            I am currently based in Mossyrock, Washington, with my small growing family. 
                            After seven years in higher education my journey into tech started with a desire 
                            to create. I love working with my hands and the satisfaction that comes from a 
                            finished product, so as a people manager, I started a novice woodworking hobby. As I 
                            approached my third decade I began exploring careers that would provide creative 
                            hands-on work while supporting my family. When I found Skillcrush's Free Code Camp, 
                            I realized that learning to code wasn't as daunting as I imagined and even provided 
                            freedom and versatility. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>
                            I was hooked and immediately signed up to learn HTML, CSS, Git/Github, Javascript, 
                            and UX Design. In January 2020 I finished the HTML/CSS curriculum and moved on 
                            to Git/Github. Though education will always shape my worldview I am pumped to be 
                            working towards finished products again. After officially transitioning out of higher 
                            education I am glad to be a burgeoning learner equipped to use my organization skills and eye 
                            for detail to write clean, elegant code.

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
